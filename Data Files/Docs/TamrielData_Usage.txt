--Usage of Assets in PT_Data.bsa--

Many of our assets were made for exclusive usage by province mods by their creators. Please make sure to contact us at http://project-tamriel.com first, if you wish to unpack something from PT_Data.bsa to use it in your own work.
That way we can check if the objects you are interested in are available for usage outside of our own projects. If you are granted usage of the objects in question, make sure the original creators are duly credited.

However, if you are prepared to add Tamriel_Data.esm as dependency to your mod and use PT_Data.bsa as-is for your project, there will be no such obligation.
If you wish to do this, don't reupload our data files to your own modpage, but ask downloaders to get Tamriel_Data from our own download mirrors. In this case there will be no need to credit us separately.


The following resources should only be used in mods with a dependency on Tamriel_data (please do not distribute the resources):
- New Khajiit race addons
- Direnni_haunted.wav sound file

All other resources can be used and redistributed alongside a dependency on Tamriel_Data.
Feel free to make mods of any description dependant upon the Project Tamriel mods. We welcome any such work that you may desire to work on.
